Employee Attendance System

## About

This application and website were built to overcome the problem of recording employee attendance in the Balaesang District government office environment. Recording of employee attendance at the Balaesang District government office has so far been done manually, namely by giving initials on attendance.

Problems arise when most employees are dishonest in filling in the absences, some entrust their friends to initial their names, some fill in absences immediately for the next few days, some fill in absences outside of time, etc. With this system, it is hoped that it can help overcome the problems that have been mentioned.
